[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a really fast static site generator. However, it is not
very accessible. In this short post I'll show you how to get your Hugo website
built on Github automatically for each git push.

 1. Sign up for [https://zammu.in/](https://zammu.in/?invitation_code=GOHUGO16) using the invitation code `GOHUGO16`.
 2. Link up your Github Profile from zammu.in's home page after signing in.
 3. Create a new site using the "Github => Hugo => Github" recipe and enter the
     github url of your hugo website e.g. *zammu/hugo.zammu.in* with the other
     details.
 4. That's it. Now you whenever you push to your github repository, your website
    built using Hugo will be published to the subdomain.zammu.in

P.S I am the founder of https://zammu.in and would love to hear your feedback on
it at [https://zammu.in/feedback](https://zammu.in/feedback?utm_src=hugo.zammu.in)

P.P.S This website is also hosted on https://zammu.in/ . You can checkout its
