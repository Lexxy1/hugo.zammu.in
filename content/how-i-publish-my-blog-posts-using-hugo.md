So, there is a discussion happening on https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/speed-of-updating-site/2557 about the ease of publishing blog posts using Hugo.

Here is how I do it using [Zammu](https://zammu.in)

I recorded a short video of me doing it, It took me less than 29 seconds to publish my blog post and all of it was automatically managed by [zammu.in][https://zammu.in]
